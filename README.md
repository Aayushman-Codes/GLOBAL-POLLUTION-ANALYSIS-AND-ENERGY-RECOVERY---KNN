# GLOBAL-POLLUTION-ANALYSIS-AND-ENERGY-RECOVERY---KNN
**Global Pollution Analysis and Energy Recovery using K-Nearest Neighbours**

This model was built on Kaggle Notebook since the code might not work on Jupyter Notebook due to version diferences or thw use of Jupyter Web (which isnt the problem with Kaggle Notebook). The main source code utilises Machine Learning Algorithms specified to give the required output (included with the code itself).

**Original Kaggle Notebook Link:** https://www.kaggle.com/code/aayushmancodez/global-pollution-analysis-bayes-v5

**To run the model:**

1) Open Kaggle.

2) Create a new Notebook.

3) Copy and paste the source code from this project into your new notebook.

4) Run the notebook to see the output.

**Model Summary**

Type of Model: K-Nearest Neighbours (Naive Bayes Algorithm)

Objective: The goal of this model is to classify countries into different pollution severity categories (Low, Medium, High) based on pollution levels, energy consumption, and other environmental factors.

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
